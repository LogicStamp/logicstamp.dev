# Privacy & Security

Last updated: December 2025

## Privacy Policy

### Information We Collect

LogicStamp is committed to protecting your privacy. We collect minimal information necessary to provide our services. We only collect this information if you actively choose to subscribe to the newsletter or contact us.

- **Email Address:** If you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your email address to send you updates about LogicStamp.
- **Subscription Metadata:** We store a timestamp of when you subscribed and an internal ID for managing the list. This is stored securely in our database (Supabase).
- **Theme Preference:** We store your theme preference (light/dark mode) locally in your browser using localStorage (and, where needed, similar browser storage mechanisms). This information is not transmitted to our servers.

### How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect solely for the following purposes:

- To send you newsletter updates (if you've subscribed)
- To maintain your theme preference across sessions
- To improve our website and services

### Data Storage and Security

Email addresses are stored in Supabase with Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled, ensuring only authorized service operations can access subscriber data. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

### Cookies and Local Storage

We do not use cookies on this website. We only use localStorage (and, where needed, similar browser storage mechanisms) to store your theme preference locally on your device. This essential local storage is not shared with third parties and can be cleared at any time through your browser settings.

We do not use analytics tools or third-party tracking scripts (such as Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, etc.) on this site.

### Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

- **Supabase:** Supabase acts as our data processor for subscriber emails. Their security and privacy practices are described in their own privacy policy.
- **Google Fonts:** We load fonts statically from Google Fonts to improve website performance. When your browser requests these fonts, Google Fonts may receive your device's IP address. Google may collect usage data as described in their privacy policy. The fonts are served as static assets and do not involve cookies or tracking beyond what Google's infrastructure may log.

### Data Controller

LogicStamp is the data controller for personal information collected through this website. For questions or concerns about data processing, please contact us at [logicstamp.dev@gmail.com](mailto:logicstamp.dev@gmail.com).

### Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- Request access to your personal information
- Request correction of inaccurate information
- Request deletion of your personal information
- Unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time

Every newsletter email contains an unsubscribe link that allows you to opt out immediately. You can also contact us directly to exercise any of these rights at [logicstamp.dev@gmail.com](mailto:logicstamp.dev@gmail.com).

### Data Retention

We retain your email address for as long as you remain subscribed to our newsletter. If you unsubscribe using the link in our emails or contact us to remove your data, we will delete your email address from our database. Theme preferences stored in your browser remain until you clear them.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via email to the maintainers:

**Email:** [logicstamp.dev@gmail.com](mailto:logicstamp.dev@gmail.com)

We aim to acknowledge your email within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information with your report:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After you submit a security report:

1. **Acknowledgement:** We aim to acknowledge your email within 48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 7 days indicating the next steps in handling your report.

2. **Verification:** We'll verify the issue and determine its severity and impact.

3. **Fix Development:** If accepted, we'll develop a fix in a private repository to prevent premature disclosure.

4. **Release:** We'll release a patch version addressing the vulnerability and credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

We do not currently offer a formal bug bounty program, but we are happy to credit researchers who help us improve LogicStamp.

### Security When Using LogicStamp Context

LogicStamp Context reads your local source files, does not execute them, never makes network requests, and only writes output files (such as `context.json` and `context_main.json`) into your project directory. For the full CLI security policy, see the [LogicStamp Context SECURITY.md on GitHub](https://github.com/LogicStamp/logicstamp-context/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
