<summary><strong>📌 TL;DR</strong></summary>

**What it does:** Uses AST parsing to extract deterministic component contracts from your TypeScript codebase.

**What you get:** Structured JSON bundles (props, hooks, dependencies, APIs) optimized for AI consumption.

**Why it matters:** Gives AI assistants explicit architectural context without reading implementations - prevents inferred prop names and missed dependencies by making contracts explicit.

## The Problem

AI coding assistants can read your source code, but they lack explicit structural context. They often infer prop names, invent dependencies, and miss breaking changes - because raw source code isn't machine-structured context.

**LogicStamp Context** is a compiler-like static analyzer that emits deterministic architectural contracts from your TypeScript source code.

**LogicStamp Context generates deterministic component contracts that:**
- Stay in sync with your code (watch mode auto-regenerates)
- Expose what matters (props, hooks, dependencies) without implementation noise
- Work with any MCP-compatible AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, etc.)

![LogicStamp MCP Workflow](./assets/logicstamp-workflow.gif)
*Context bundles generated and consumed across MCP-powered AI workflows.*

**Same code ⇒ same context output.** Diff outputs to detect architectural drift.

```
TypeScript Code  →  AST Parsing  →  Deterministic Contracts  →  AI Assistant
   (.ts/.tsx)        (ts-morph)      (context.json bundles)      (Claude, Cursor)
```

---

## Quick Start

**Try it in 30 seconds (no install required):**
```bash
npx logicstamp-context context
```

Scans your repo and writes `context.json` files + `context_main.json` for AI tools.

**What you get:**
- 📁 `context.json` files - one per folder with components, preserving your directory structure
- 📋 `context_main.json` - index file with project overview and folder metadata

**For a complete setup (recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g logicstamp-context
stamp init        # sets up .gitignore, scans for secrets
stamp context
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** With `npx`, run `npx logicstamp-context context`. After global install, use `stamp context`.

📋 **For detailed setup instructions, see the [Getting Started Guide](https://logicstamp.dev/docs/getting-started).**

## Drift Detection

Compare regenerated context against existing context files (useful for one-time checks and CI workflows):

```bash
stamp context compare          # detect changes
stamp context compare --approve  # update (like jest -u)
```

Shows added/removed components, changed props, hooks, dependencies.

> **💡 Tip:** If you're using [watch mode](#watch-mode), context files are automatically regenerated and changes are shown in real-time. Use `compare` for one-time checks or CI workflows.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Context files are gitignored by default. For CI-based drift detection, the `--baseline git:<ref>` option (e.g., `--baseline git:main`) is **not yet implemented**. Until automation is available, use the manual workflow: generate context from current code, checkout baseline branch, generate context from baseline, then compare. See the [roadmap](https://logicstamp.dev/roadmap) for planned automation.

## Why Structured Context?

| Without LogicStamp Context | With LogicStamp Context |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| AI parses 200 lines of implementation to infer a component's interface | AI reads a 20-line interface contract |
| Props/hooks inferred (often wrong) | Props/hooks explicit and verified |
| No way to know if context is stale | Watch mode catches changes in real-time |
| Different prompts = different understanding | Deterministic: same code = same contract |
| Manual context gathering: "Here's my Button component..." | Structured contracts: AI understands architecture automatically |

**The key insight:** AI assistants don't need your implementation - they need your *interfaces*. LogicStamp Context extracts what matters and discards the noise.

### What "Structured" Means

Instead of shipping raw source code to AI:

```typescript
// Raw: AI must parse and infer
export const Button = ({ variant = 'primary', disabled, onClick, children }) => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
  // ... 150 more lines of implementation
}
```

LogicStamp Context generates:

```json
{
  "kind": "react:component",
  "interface": {
    "props": {
      "variant": { "type": "literal-union", "literals": ["primary", "secondary"] },
      "disabled": { "type": "boolean" },
      "onClick": { "type": "function", "signature": "() => void" }
    }
  },
  "composition": { "hooks": ["useState"], "components": ["./Icon"] }
}
```

Pre-parsed. Categorized. Stable. The AI reads contracts, not implementations.

## ⚡ Features

**Core:**
- **Deterministic contracts** - Same input = same output, auditable in version control
- **Watch mode** - Auto-regenerate on file changes with incremental rebuilds
- **Breaking change detection** - Strict watch mode catches removed props, events, functions in real-time
- **MCP-ready** - AI agents consume context via standardized MCP interface

**Analysis:**
- React/Next.js/Vue component extraction (props, hooks, state, deps)
- Backend API extraction (Express.js, NestJS routes and controllers)
- Dependency graphs (handles circular dependencies)
- Style metadata extraction (Tailwind, SCSS, MUI, shadcn)
- Next.js App Router detection (client/server, layouts, pages)

**Developer experience:**
- Per-folder bundles matching your project structure
- Accurate token estimates (GPT/Claude)
- Security-first: automatic secret detection and sanitization
- Zero config required - sensible defaults, works out of the box

## Watch Mode

For development, run watch mode to keep context fresh as you code:

```bash
# Basic watch - regenerate on changes
stamp context --watch

# Strict watch - also detect breaking changes in real-time
stamp context --watch --strict-watch
```

Strict watch catches breaking changes that affect consumers:

| Violation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| `breaking_change_prop_removed` | Removed `disabled` prop from Button |
| `breaking_change_event_removed` | Removed `onSubmit` callback |
| `breaking_change_function_removed` | Deleted exported `formatDate()` |
| `contract_removed` | Deleted entire component |

**Recommended workflow:**

```
stamp context --watch --strict-watch
         ↓
Real-time breaking change detection
Context always fresh as you code
```

## How it Works

1. **Scan** - Finds all `.ts` and `.tsx` files in your project
2. **Analyze** - Parses components and APIs using TypeScript AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) via `ts-morph`
3. **Extract** - Builds contracts with props, hooks, state, signatures
4. **Graph** - Creates dependency graph showing relationships
5. **Bundle** - Packages context optimized for AI consumption
6. **Organize** - Groups by folder, writes `context.json` files
7. **Index** - Creates `context_main.json` with metadata and statistics

**Why AST parsing matters:** Unlike text-based parsing (regex, string matching), AST parsing understands TypeScript's syntax structure, type information, and code semantics. This enables LogicStamp Context to accurately extract prop types, detect hooks, understand component composition, and handle complex patterns reliably - making contracts deterministic and trustworthy.

No pre-compilation needed. One command.

> **💡Tip:** Use `stamp context` for basic contracts. Use `stamp context style` when you need style metadata (Tailwind classes, SCSS selectors, layout patterns).

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 What LogicStamp Context Is (and Isn't)</strong></summary>

**LogicStamp Context IS:**

✅ **An AST-based static analysis tool** - Uses the TypeScript compiler API (via ts-morph) to extract component contracts, props, hooks, and dependencies in a deterministic, type-aware way.

✅ **A deterministic context generator** - Produces structured architectural contract bundles for tooling and AI workflows.

✅ **Local and offline-first** - Runs entirely on your machine (no cloud services, no network calls).

✅ **Framework-aware** - Understands React, Next.js, Vue, Express, and NestJS patterns and extracts relevant metadata.

✅ **Non-opinionated** - Describes what exists without enforcing patterns or architectural decisions.

**LogicStamp Context IS NOT:**

❌ **A code generator** - It never writes or modifies your source code.

❌ **A documentation generator** - It produces structured contracts, not documentation.

❌ **A build or runtime tool** - It analyzes static source code only; it does not execute or bundle your application.

❌ **A linter, formatter, or testing framework** - It does not check code quality or run tests.

❌ **An AI behavior controller** - It provides structured context; it does not alter AI responses.

❌ **A replacement for reading code** - It accelerates understanding without replacing engineering judgment.

## MCP Server

For AI assistants with MCP support (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

```bash
npm install -g logicstamp-mcp
```

Then configure your AI assistant to use the LogicStamp MCP Server.

📋 **See [MCP Getting Started Guide](https://logicstamp.dev/docs/mcp/getting-started)** for setup instructions.

## Example Output

LogicStamp Context generates structured JSON bundles organized by folder:

```json
{
  "type": "LogicStampBundle",
  "entryId": "src/components/Button.tsx",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "entryId": "src/components/Button.tsx",
        "contract": {
          "kind": "react:component",
          "interface": {
            "props": {
              "variant": { "type": "literal-union", "literals": ["primary", "secondary"] },
              "onClick": { "type": "function", "signature": "() => void" }
            }
          },
          "composition": {
            "hooks": ["useState"],
            "components": ["./Icon"]
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [["src/components/Button.tsx", "./Icon"]]
  }
}
```

📋 **See [docs/schema.md](https://github.com/LogicStamp/logicstamp-context/blob/main/docs/schema.md)** for complete format documentation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g logicstamp-context
```

After installation, the `stamp` command is available globally.

## Security

**Automatic Secret Protection**

LogicStamp Context protects sensitive data in generated context:

- **Security scanning by default** - `stamp init` scans for secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Automatic sanitization** - Detected secrets replaced with `"PRIVATE_DATA"` in output
- **Manual exclusions** - Use `stamp ignore <file>` to exclude files via `.stampignore`
- **Safe by default** - Only metadata included. Credentials only appear in `--include-code full` mode

> **⚠️ Seeing `"PRIVATE_DATA"` in output?** Review `stamp_security_report.json`, remove hardcoded secrets from source, use environment variables instead.

🔒 **See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/LogicStamp/logicstamp-context/blob/main/SECURITY.md)** for complete security documentation.

## Usage

```bash
stamp --version                    # Show version
stamp --help                       # Show help
stamp init [path]                  # Initialize project (security scan by default)
stamp ignore <path>                # Add to .stampignore
stamp context [path]               # Generate context bundles
stamp context style [path]         # Generate with style metadata
stamp context --watch              # Watch mode
stamp context --watch --strict-watch  # Watch with breaking change detection
stamp context compare              # Detect changes vs existing context
