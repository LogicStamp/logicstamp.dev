## The Problem

AI coding assistants read your source code - but they don’t understand its structure.  
They hallucinate props, miss dependencies, and can’t detect when a breaking change impacts consumers.

Example: your `Button` accepts `variant` and `disabled`, but the AI suggests `isLoading` because it saw that pattern elsewhere. Without a structured contract, there is no reliable source of truth.

**LogicStamp Context** compiles TypeScript into deterministic architectural contracts and dependency graphs - a machine-readable representation of your system that AI tools can consume instead of parsing raw implementation code.

These contracts:

- Stay in sync with your code (watch mode auto-regenerates)
- Expose interfaces (props, hooks, APIs) without implementation noise
- Are deterministic, diffable, and auditable
- Enable early detection of architectural drift and breaking changes

![LogicStamp MCP Workflow](./assets/logicstamp-workflow.gif)
*Example workflow: `stamp context --strict-watch` generates context bundles that MCP-powered assistants use to explain component architecture (ThemeContext shown here).*

**Same code ⇒ same context output.** Contracts are diffable, so you can detect drift and breaking changes.

```
TypeScript Code  →  Compilation  →  Deterministic Contracts  →  AI Assistant
   (.ts/.tsx)        (ts-morph)       (context.json bundles)     (Claude, Cursor)
```

---

## Quick Start

**Try it in 30 seconds (no install required):**
```bash
npx logicstamp-context context
```

Scans your repo and writes `context.json` files + `context_main.json` for AI tools.

**What you get:**
- 📁 `context.json` files - one per folder with components, preserving your directory structure
- 📋 `context_main.json` - index file with project overview and folder metadata

**For a complete setup (recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g logicstamp-context
stamp init        # sets up .gitignore, scans for secrets
stamp context
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** With `npx`, run `npx logicstamp-context context`. After global install, use `stamp context`.

📋 **For detailed setup instructions, see the [Getting Started Guide](https://logicstamp.dev/docs/getting-started).**

## Why Structured Context?

| Without LogicStamp Context | With LogicStamp Context |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| AI parses 200 lines of implementation to infer a component's interface | AI reads a 20-line interface contract |
| Props/hooks inferred (often wrong) | Props/hooks explicit and verified |
| No way to know if context is stale | Watch mode catches changes in real-time |
| Different prompts = different understanding | Deterministic: same code = same contract |
| Manual context gathering: "Here's my Button component..." | Structured contracts: AI understands architecture automatically |

**The key insight:** AI assistants don't need your implementation - they need your *interfaces*. LogicStamp Context extracts what matters and discards the noise.

### What "Structured" Means

Instead of shipping raw source code to AI:

```typescript
// Raw: AI must parse and infer
export const Button = ({ variant = 'primary', disabled, onClick, children }) => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
  // ... 150 more lines of implementation
}
```

LogicStamp Context generates:

```json
{
  "kind": "react:component",
  "interface": {
    "props": {
      "variant": { "type": "literal-union", "literals": ["primary", "secondary"] },
      "disabled": { "type": "boolean" },
      "onClick": { "type": "function", "signature": "() => void" }
    }
  },
  "composition": { "hooks": ["useState"], "components": ["./Icon"] }
}
```

Pre-parsed. Categorized. Stable. The AI reads contracts, not implementations.

## ⚡ Features

**Core:**
- **Deterministic contracts** - Same input = same output, auditable in version control
- **Watch mode** - Auto-regenerate on file changes with incremental rebuilds
- **Breaking change detection** - Strict watch mode catches removed props, events, functions in real-time
- **MCP-ready** - AI agents consume context via standardized MCP interface

**Analysis:**
- React/Next.js/Vue component extraction (props, hooks, state, deps)
- Backend API extraction (Express.js, NestJS routes and controllers)
- Dependency graphs (handles circular dependencies)
- Style metadata extraction (Tailwind, SCSS, MUI, shadcn)
- Next.js App Router detection (client/server, layouts, pages)

**Developer experience:**
- Per-folder bundles matching your project structure
- Accurate token estimates (GPT/Claude)
- Security-first: automatic secret detection and sanitization
- Zero config required - sensible defaults, works out of the box

## Watch Mode

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/logicstamp-strict-watch.gif" width="820" />
</p>

*Strict watch mode in action: detecting violations and clearing them when resolved.*

For development, run watch mode to keep context fresh as you code:

```bash
stamp context --watch                  # regenerate on changes
stamp context --strict-watch           # also detect breaking changes (implies --watch)
```
Strict watch catches breaking changes that affect consumers:

| Violation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| `breaking_change_prop_removed` | Removed `disabled` prop from Button |
| `breaking_change_event_removed` | Removed `onSubmit` callback |
| `breaking_change_function_removed` | Deleted exported `formatDate()` |
| `contract_removed` | Deleted entire component |

**Errors vs Warnings:** Violations are classified by severity:

**❌ Errors** indicate breaking changes that will affect consumers (removed props, events, functions, or entire contracts).

**⚠️ Warnings** indicate less severe changes (type signature changes, removed internal state). Violations are tracked in real-time and automatically cleared when resolved.

**Session Status Tracking:** Strict watch mode displays a session status block showing cumulative statistics:
- **Errors/Warnings detected**: Total violations detected during the session
- **Resolved**: Number of times all violations were completely resolved
- **Active**: Current number of active violations

The status block only appears when violations change (not on every file change), keeping terminal output clean.

![Strict Watch Mode Terminal Output](./assets/logicstamp-strict-watch-output.png)

*Example terminal output showing violations and session status.*

> ℹ️ **Note:** Strict Watch currently detects breaking changes at the source. Next step: a symbol-level import/export reverse index to trace which consumer files will break.

### One-time Comparison

Compare regenerated context against existing files:

```bash
stamp context compare            # detect changes
stamp context compare --approve  # update (like jest -u)
```

Useful for reviewing changes before committing or validating context is up-to-date.

**Git baseline comparison** *(v0.7.2)*: Compare against any git ref:
```bash
stamp context compare --baseline git:main      # Compare against main branch
stamp context compare --baseline git:HEAD      # Compare against HEAD
stamp context compare --baseline git:v1.0.0    # Compare against a tag
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** Context files are gitignored by default. Git baseline comparison uses git worktrees to generate context for both the baseline ref and the current working tree, then performs a structural contract comparison. See [docs/cli/compare.md](docs/cli/compare.md) for complete documentation.

## How it Works

The compilation pipeline:

1. **Scan** - Discovers all `.ts` and `.tsx` source files
2. **Parse** - Builds AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) via `ts-morph` using the TypeScript compiler API
3. **Extract** - Compiles contracts with props, hooks, state, signatures
4. **Graph** - Resolves dependency relationships
5. **Emit** - Outputs `context.json` bundles per folder
6. **Index** - Generates `context_main.json` with metadata and statistics

**Why AST-based compilation matters:** LogicStamp leverages the full TypeScript compiler (via ts-morph) for deterministic, type-aware contract extraction. Prop types, hooks, and composition patterns are resolved structurally - not inferred from text or retrieval.

One command. No build step required.

> **💡Tip:** Use `stamp context` for basic contracts. Use `stamp context style` when you need style metadata (Tailwind classes, SCSS selectors, layout patterns). Use `--style-mode lean` (default) for compact output or `--style-mode full` for detailed arrays.

<details>
<summary><strong>📋 What LogicStamp Context Is (and Isn't)</strong></summary>

**LogicStamp Context IS:**

✅ **A context compiler** - Uses the TypeScript compiler API (via ts-morph) to compile source code into deterministic architectural contracts.

✅ **Deterministic** - Same input always produces the same output. Contracts are auditable and diffable.

✅ **Local execution** - Runs entirely on your machine (no cloud services, no network calls).

✅ **Framework-aware** - Understands React, Next.js, Vue, Express, and NestJS patterns and extracts relevant metadata.

✅ **Non-opinionated** - Describes what exists without enforcing patterns or architectural decisions.

**LogicStamp Context IS NOT:**

❌ **A code generator** - It never writes or modifies your source code.

❌ **A documentation generator** - It produces structured contracts, not documentation.

❌ **A build or runtime tool** - It compiles contracts from static source code; it does not execute or bundle your application.

❌ **A linter, formatter, or testing framework** - It does not check code quality or run tests.

❌ **An AI behavior controller** - It provides structured context; it does not alter AI responses.

❌ **A replacement for reading code** - It accelerates understanding without replacing engineering judgment.

## MCP Server

For AI assistants with MCP support (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

```bash
npm install -g logicstamp-mcp
```

Then configure your AI assistant to use the LogicStamp MCP Server.

🔗 **See [LogicStamp MCP Server Repository](https://github.com/LogicStamp/logicstamp-mcp)**

📋 **See [MCP Getting Started Guide](https://logicstamp.dev/docs/mcp/getting-started)** for setup instructions.

## Example Output

LogicStamp Context generates structured JSON bundles organized by folder:

```json
{
  "type": "LogicStampBundle",
  "entryId": "src/components/Button.tsx",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "entryId": "src/components/Button.tsx",
        "contract": {
          "kind": "react:component",
          "interface": {
            "props": {
              "variant": { "type": "literal-union", "literals": ["primary", "secondary"] },
              "onClick": { "type": "function", "signature": "() => void" }
            }
          },
          "composition": {
            "hooks": ["useState"],
            "components": ["./Icon"]
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [["src/components/Button.tsx", "./Icon"]]
  }
}
```

📋 **See [docs/schema.md](https://github.com/LogicStamp/logicstamp-context/blob/main/docs/schema.md)** for complete format documentation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g logicstamp-context
```

After installation, the `stamp` command is available globally.

## Security

**Automatic Secret Protection**

LogicStamp Context protects sensitive data in generated context:

- **Security scanning by default** - `stamp init` scans source files (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`) and `.json` files for hard-coded secrets before context compilation
- **Automatic sanitization** - Detected secrets replaced with `"PRIVATE_DATA"` in output
- **Manual exclusions** - Use `stamp ignore <file>` to exclude files via `.stampignore`
- **Safe by default** - Only metadata included. Credentials only appear in `--include-code full` mode

> **⚠️ Seeing `"PRIVATE_DATA"` in output?** Review `stamp_security_report.json`, remove hardcoded secrets from source, use environment variables instead.

🔒 **See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/LogicStamp/logicstamp-context/blob/main/SECURITY.md)** for complete security documentation.
