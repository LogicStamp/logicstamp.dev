> **TL;DR:** LogicStamp statically analyzes your TypeScript codebase and emits deterministic context bundles (machine-readable contracts for props, hooks, dependencies, APIs) giving AI assistants explicit architectural context without reading implementations.

## The Problem

AI coding assistants can read your source code, but they lack explicit architectural context. They hallucinate prop names, invent dependencies, and miss breaking changes - because raw source code isn't structured context.

**LogicStamp generates deterministic component contracts that:**
- Stay in sync with your code (watch mode auto-regenerates)
- Expose what matters (props, hooks, dependencies) without implementation noise
- Work with any MCP-compatible AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, etc.)

*Context bundles generated and consumed across MCP-powered AI workflows.*

## What LogicStamp Is (and Isn't)

**LogicStamp IS:**
- ✅ **A static analysis tool** - Extracts component contracts, props, hooks, and dependencies from your TypeScript codebase
- ✅ **A context generator** - Creates structured JSON bundles optimized for AI consumption
- ✅ **A replacement for manual context gathering** - No more explaining your codebase structure to AI assistants; contracts provide instant architectural understanding
- ✅ **Local and offline-first** - Runs entirely on your machine, no cloud services or network calls
- ✅ **Deterministic** - Same code always produces the same contracts (auditable in version control)
- ✅ **Framework-aware** - Understands React, Next.js, Vue, Express, NestJS patterns and extracts relevant metadata
- ✅ **Non-opinionated** - It describes what exists in your codebase; it does not enforce patterns, architectures, or best practices

**LogicStamp IS NOT:**
- ❌ **A code generator** - It doesn't write or modify your source code
- ❌ **A linter or formatter** - It doesn't check code quality or enforce style rules
- ❌ **A build tool** - It doesn't compile, bundle, or transform your code
- ❌ **A runtime tool** - It analyzes static source files, not running applications
- ❌ **A replacement for TypeScript** - It extracts type information but doesn't provide type checking
- ❌ **A testing framework** - It doesn't run tests or generate test code
- ❌ **A cloud service** - All processing happens locally on your machine
- ❌ **An AI behavior controller** - It does not instruct, constrain, or modify how an AI responds; it only provides structured context

**Think of it as:** A compiler for your codebase that emits deterministic, machine-readable architectural contracts instead of bytecode or docs.

## Quick Start

**Try it in 30 seconds (no install required):**
```bash
npx logicstamp-context context
```

Scans your repo and writes `context.json` files + `context_main.json` for AI tools.

**What you get:**
- 📁 `context.json` files - one per folder with components, preserving your directory structure
- 📋 `context_main.json` - index file with project overview and folder metadata

**For a complete setup (recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g logicstamp-context
stamp init        # sets up .gitignore, scans for secrets
stamp context
```

> **ℹ️ Note:** With `npx`, run `npx logicstamp-context context`. After global install, use `stamp context`.

## Drift Detection

Compare regenerated context against existing context files:

```bash
stamp context compare          # detect changes
stamp context compare --approve  # update (like jest -u)
```

Useful during development to see what changed. Shows added/removed components, changed props, hooks, dependencies.

> **Note:** Context files are gitignored by default. For CI-based drift detection (comparing against git refs like `main` or `HEAD~1`), see the [roadmap](https://logicstamp.dev/roadmap) - this feature is planned for a future release.

## Why Structured Context?

| Without LogicStamp | With LogicStamp |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| AI reads 200 lines to understand a component | AI reads a 20-line contract |
| Props/hooks inferred (often wrong) | Props/hooks explicit and verified |
| No way to know if context is stale | Watch mode catches changes in real-time |
| Different prompts = different understanding | Deterministic: same code = same contract |
| Manual context gathering: "Here's my Button component..." | Structured contracts: AI understands architecture automatically |

**The key insight:** AI assistants don't need your implementation - they need your *interfaces*. LogicStamp extracts what matters and discards the noise.

### What "Structured" Means

Instead of shipping raw source code to AI:

```typescript
// Raw: AI must parse and infer
export const Button = ({ variant = 'primary', disabled, onClick, children }) => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);
  // ... 150 more lines of implementation
}
```

LogicStamp generates:

```json
{
  "kind": "react:component",
  "interface": {
    "props": {
      "variant": { "type": "literal-union", "literals": ["primary", "secondary"] },
      "disabled": { "type": "boolean" },
      "onClick": { "type": "function", "signature": "() => void" }
    }
  },
  "composition": { "hooks": ["useState"], "components": ["./Icon"] }
}
```

Pre-parsed. Categorized. Stable. The AI reads contracts, not implementations.

## ⚡ Features

**Core:**
- **Deterministic contracts** - Same input = same output, auditable in version control
- **Watch mode** - Auto-regenerate on file changes with incremental rebuilds
- **Breaking change detection** - Strict watch mode catches removed props, events, functions in real-time
- **MCP-ready** - AI agents consume context via standardized MCP interface

**Analysis:**
- React/Next.js/Vue component extraction (props, hooks, state, deps)
- Backend API extraction (Express.js, NestJS routes and controllers)
- Dependency graphs with cycle detection
- Style metadata extraction (Tailwind, SCSS, MUI, shadcn)
- Next.js App Router detection (client/server, layouts, pages)

**Developer experience:**
- Per-folder bundles matching your project structure
- Accurate token estimates (GPT/Claude)
- Security-first: automatic secret detection and sanitization
- Zero config required - sensible defaults, works out of the box

## Watch Mode

For development, run watch mode to keep context fresh as you code:

```bash
# Basic watch - regenerate on changes
stamp context --watch

# Strict watch - also detect breaking changes in real-time
stamp context --watch --strict-watch
```

Strict watch catches breaking changes that affect consumers:

| Violation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| `prop_removed` | Removed `disabled` prop from Button |
| `event_removed` | Removed `onSubmit` callback |
| `function_removed` | Deleted exported `formatDate()` |
| `contract_removed` | Deleted entire component |

**Recommended workflow:**

```
stamp context --watch --strict-watch
         ↓
Real-time breaking change detection
Context always fresh as you code
```

## How it Works

1. **Scan** - Finds all `.ts` and `.tsx` files in your project
2. **Analyze** - Parses components and APIs using TypeScript AST
3. **Extract** - Builds contracts with props, hooks, state, signatures
4. **Graph** - Creates dependency graph showing relationships
5. **Bundle** - Packages context optimized for AI consumption
6. **Organize** - Groups by folder, writes `context.json` files
7. **Index** - Creates `context_main.json` with metadata and statistics

No pre-compilation needed. One command.

> **Tip:** Use `stamp context` for basic contracts. Use `stamp context style` when you need style metadata (Tailwind classes, SCSS selectors, layout patterns).

## MCP Server

For AI assistants with MCP support (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

```bash
npm install -g logicstamp-mcp
```

Then configure your AI assistant to use the LogicStamp MCP Server.

📋 **See [MCP Getting Started Guide](https://logicstamp.dev/docs/mcp/getting-started)** for setup instructions.

## Example Output

LogicStamp generates structured JSON bundles organized by folder:

```json
{
  "type": "LogicStampBundle",
  "entryId": "src/components/Button.tsx",
  "graph": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "entryId": "src/components/Button.tsx",
        "contract": {
          "kind": "react:component",
          "interface": {
            "props": {
              "variant": { "type": "literal-union", "literals": ["primary", "secondary"] },
              "onClick": { "type": "function", "signature": "() => void" }
            }
          },
          "composition": {
            "hooks": ["useState"],
            "components": ["./Icon"]
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "edges": [["src/components/Button.tsx", "./Icon"]]
  }
}
```

📋 **See [docs/schema.md](https://github.com/LogicStamp/logicstamp-context/blob/main/docs/schema.md)** for complete format documentation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g logicstamp-context
```

After installation, the `stamp` command is available globally.

## Security

**Automatic Secret Protection**

LogicStamp protects sensitive data in generated context:

- **Security scanning by default** - `stamp init` scans for secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Automatic sanitization** - Detected secrets replaced with `"PRIVATE_DATA"` in output
- **Manual exclusions** - Use `stamp ignore <file>` to exclude files via `.stampignore`
- **Safe by default** - Only metadata included; credentials only appear in `--include-code full` mode

> **⚠️ Seeing `"PRIVATE_DATA"` in output?** Review `stamp_security_report.json`, remove hardcoded secrets from source, use environment variables instead.

🔒 **See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/LogicStamp/logicstamp-context/blob/main/SECURITY.md)** for complete security documentation.

## Usage

```bash
stamp --version                    # Show version
stamp --help                       # Show help
stamp init [path]                  # Initialize project (security scan by default)
stamp ignore <path>                # Add to .stampignore
stamp context [path]               # Generate context bundles
stamp context style [path]         # Generate with style metadata
stamp context --watch              # Watch mode
stamp context --watch --strict-watch  # Watch with breaking change detection
stamp context compare              # Detect changes vs existing context
stamp context validate [file]      # Validate context files
stamp context clean [path]         # Remove generated files
```
