🔐 Hashes in LogicStamp

LogicStamp uses three complementary hash types to track file changes, semantic changes, and bundle-level changes:

fileHash – detects any raw file content modification.

semanticHash – detects meaningful logical or contract changes.

bundleHash – tracks changes to an entire LLM context bundle.

📄 fileHash: Raw File Content Hash
Purpose

Answers: “Did the raw source file change?”

Used as a hash lock so LogicStamp can validate that a stored contract still reflects the actual file.

How it is computed

Take the raw file contents.

Strip the @uif metadata header block.

Normalize line endings (\r\n → \n).

SHA-256 hash the text.

Truncate to 24 hex chars.

Prefix with uif:.

Example:

uif:1f0fa0e2c8958d7fc1696036

What changes fileHash

Any code change

Comment changes

Formatting / whitespace changes

Structural edits

Line ending differences (after normalization)

What does not change it

Editing the @uif header

Purely changing metadata

Example
"contract": {
  "semanticHash": "uif:1a27d0944bbaaf561ee05a01",
  "fileHash": "uif:1f0fa0e2c8958d7fc1696036"
}

🧠 semanticHash: Logical / Contract Hash
Purpose

Answers: “Did the component’s semantics or public API change?”

This hash tracks meaningful changes only—not superficial edits.

Based on

Derived from the AST and logic signature:

Structural footprint:

variables

hooks

components

functions

Logic signature:

props

emits/events

state

A stable schemaVersion (e.g., "0.3")

All arrays/objects are sorted deterministically for order-independence, via `stableStringify` and `sortObject`.

How it is computed

Extract AST structure (AstExtract) and logic signature, then feed them into `semanticHashFromAst`, which internally combines `structureHash` and `signatureHash`.

Build payload:

{
  "schemaVersion": "0.3",
  "structure": { "...": "..." },
  "signature": { "...": "..." }
}


Stable-stringify and SHA-256.

Truncate to 24 hex chars.

Prefix with uif:.

What changes semanticHash

Adding/removing/renaming props

Changing events (emits)

Changing state structure

Adding/removing named functions, hooks, or child components

Any structural AST shift that affects contract shape

What does not change it

Comments

Whitespace/formatting

Most implementation details inside functions

Internal logic refactors that do not affect:

props

events

state

component/hook/function footprint

🗂 bundleHash: LLM Bundle Hash
Purpose

Answers: “Has the entire context bundle changed?”

Used for caching embeddings and prepared LLM contexts.

Based on

A bundle’s hash includes:

Sorted list of nodes (by `entryId`):

{ "entryId": "...", "semanticHash": "uif:..." }


Bundle depth

Bundle schemaVersion (default "0.1")

Example payload:

{
  "schemaVersion": "0.1",
  "depth": 1,
  "nodes": [
    { "entryId": "src/Button.tsx", "semanticHash": "uif:..." },
    { "entryId": "src/Card.tsx",   "semanticHash": "uif:..." }
  ]
}


Then:

stable-stringify

SHA-256

truncate

prefix with uifb:

Example:

uifb:abc123e4f99aa01deef02bb1

What changes bundleHash

Any component’s semanticHash changed

Adding/removing a component from the bundle

Different bundle depth

Different bundle schema version

What does not change it

Cosmetic file edits

Reordering components in memory (sorting by `entryId` ensures stability)

🧬 Relationship Between All Three Hashes

Think of these as three layers:

Layer	Hash	Detects
File-level	fileHash	Any file content modification
Component-level	semanticHash	Logic & API changes only
Bundle-level	bundleHash	Changes in the semantic footprint of a context bundle
🔎 Practical Scenarios
1. Only comments/formatting change

fileHash: changes

semanticHash: stays same

bundleHash: stays same

→ Cosmetic edit.

2. A prop or state field is added

fileHash: changes

semanticHash: changes

bundleHash: changes for all bundles involving that component

→ Meaningful contract change.

3. A dependency graph changes (component import added/removed)

semanticHash (maybe stays same)

bundleHash: changes, because node set changed

→ Bundle must be regenerated for LLM.
